This first week of attending the Nashville Software School has been quite the experience. I have felt like I'm 10 steps behind almost everyday except for the first one of course. We got started with the HTML and CSS first... The CSS I had trouble grasping and still continue to struggle with but at least I got html structure so far. Hopefully I'll be able to get caught up eventually.
